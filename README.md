# Project Information
I want to create a database where users can post math questions that they have, very similar to stackexchange but hoping to tie in some wolfram. 
The user will post the question to the community, the community users will be able to answer the question or if the question is solved, then they can dispute it or like/agree to the solution, and they can also post a different method at which they got to it. 

## Feature List
* Convert text/copied text to LaTex
* Show user activity history on graph
